While fan debates and announcer predictions happen before, during, and after the season. The decision ultimately rests on a vote by the conference’s head coaches, who weigh multiple critical factors.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Big Ten has long held the reputation as the dominant women’s volleyball conference, but that status is now being actively debated. The SEC has become a strong contender, adding No. 3 Texas to an existing powerhouse, No. 2 Kentucky, leading some fans to believe the SEC deserves the title. The Pac-12 is often overlooked, which arguably should have been considered the power conference all along due to its record for the most national championships. In recent years, the conversation has centered around the Big Ten, SEC, and ACC, thanks to their dominant seasons over the past five years. As college volleyball continues to rise in popularity, regular season and national championship viewership is seeing a significant increase.\nSo who is actually the power conference and does it depend on the season?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggbump)\n\nnc &lt;- read_csv(\"TotalNationalChampionships.csv\")\npc &lt;- read_csv(\"VolleyballData.csv\")\nviews &lt;- read_csv(\"Views.csv\")\n\nconf &lt;- pc |&gt; \n  group_by(conference) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    opponent_total_attacks = mean(opponent_hit_pct),\n    total_attacks = mean(hit_pct)\n  ) \n\nbig12 &lt;- pc |&gt; filter(conference == \"Big 12\")\nacc &lt;- pc |&gt; filter(conference == \"ACC\")\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=pc, aes(x=reorder(conference, hit_pct), weight=hit_pct), fill=\"#000000\") + \n  geom_bar(data=acc, aes(x=reorder(conference, hit_pct), weight=hit_pct), fill=\"#013CA6\") + \n  coord_flip() + \n  labs( \n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average Hitting Percentage\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=pc, aes(x=reorder(conference, opponent_hit_pct), weight=opponent_hit_pct), fill=\"#000000\") + \n  geom_bar(data=big12, aes(x=reorder(conference, opponent_hit_pct), weight=opponent_hit_pct), fill=\"#C41230\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs( \n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average Opponent Hitting Percentage\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nbar1 + bar2 + \n  plot_annotation( \n    title = \"Which conference leads in hitting and opponent percentage?\",\n    subtitle = \"The conference average hitting percentage and opponent hitting percentage over the past 5 years.\",\n    caption = \"Source: NCAA | By Lindsay McMullen \"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main statistics that viewers and announcers look at when it comes to determining a conference’s dominance is hitting percentage and opponent hitting percentage.

The historic Pac-12 has broken up, dispersing programs like Stanford, UCLA, USC, Oregon and Washington. The ACC has added Stanford and California. The Big Ten added four new Top 25 contenders. The SEC gained a competitive edge with additions like Oklahoma and Texas, with Kentucky leading the conference. The Big 12 has also seen its ranks boosted, notably with the addition of Top 25-ranked Colorado.\n\n\nCode\nBig10 &lt;- nc |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Conference == \"Big 10\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=nc, aes(x=reorder(Conference, Total), weight= Total) , fill = \"black\") + \n  geom_bar(data=Big10, aes(x=reorder(Conference, Total), weight= Total), fill = \"#0088CE\") +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Tracking which conference claims the most National Titles \", \n    subtitle=\"The Pac-12 leads the Power 5 conferences with the most national championships\", \n    y= \"\", \n    x = \"Conference\",\n    caption = \"Source: NCAA | By Lindsay McMullen\", \n    color=\"Conference\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACC has had teams in the national championship and final four every year, but they have yet to win a title. The Pac-12 leads the national title race with 17 and Stanford leading the conference. The Big 12 is 2nd or currently leads the national championship race with 15.

The lowest viewed national championship over the past 10 year was 2019: Stanford vs Wisconsin, with Stanford winning. There was a drop in viewership last year with Penn State and Louisville match, even though it was a historical game with the first ever female coach winning.\nWill this years national championship viewership increase or stay the same?"
